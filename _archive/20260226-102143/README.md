#browser=Chrome- -> to run in chrome

#browser=Firefox- -> to run in firefox

BUILD=build

URL=`<HomePageURL>`

#URL=www.google.com

ReportPath=cx_reports

testType="`<test type>`"

#testType="pt" -> to trigger client-side performance test

#testType="at" -> to trigger accessibility validations

iterationCount=`<Numberofperformanceiterations>`

#iterationCount=2 -> to run 2 iterations (maximum it will support 3 iterations)

### CxA Viewer 2.0 Methods

**1.In the setup() method, find the direct urls provided for performance and accessibility validations (you can write the code for the click event as well)**
